In this section, we are going to learn about the world of digital circuits and explore the foundational components that power today's electronics. Digital circuits are the backbone of countless devices we interact with daily, from smartphones to computers and beyond.

Check out some circuit designs in the [slides](../downloadables/lec_slides/ISC_lec4.pdf) of Lecture 4 (from pages 31-33, 39-59). Keep these pages as reference while going through the Verilog designs of various digital circuits.

Let's jump right in and uncover the magic of digital circuits through magical Verilog! âœ¨</div>
